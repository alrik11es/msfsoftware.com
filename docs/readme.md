Welcome to msfsoftware.com.

This is a personal website that I use as documentation page, mainly.

If you have an email account you can enter [here](http://mail.msfsoftware.com).

I wrote some articles that you can see here. For my own personal mind sanity I will probably write the articles in spanish language. Not necesarily will be like that but for now...

The main documentation for my libraries can be accessed [here](documentation-home.md).

## Articles

Here you can see my latest posts, mainly in spanish... but you could in the future find some in english.

- The magic and the hell of elastic beanstalk [[ES](articles/ES/magic-hell-of-elastic-beanstalk.md)]
